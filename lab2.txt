Conclusion:
Although three different models were used above, it does indeed seem like that distribution of the number of strikes is the same under each of these sets of assumptions. For example, when we look at the general shape of each of the three distributions we see that they are indeed very similar to eachother. In addition, when examining the means of each of these models, we found that they were very close. However, it is interesting to note that the Poission distribution had the highest mean (~4.5), while the model created using boxmodeling techniques had the lowest mean (~4.4). In addition, we saw that the exponential distribution had a mean in the middle of these three models (~4.45).
